# "Modes" for rust-project?

This functionality is undocumented but it's a bunch of files, one of which  
gets read as a list of command line arguments to some buck2 invocation, when 
you run `rust-project develop`. What exactly to put in these files, I don't 
know. But you need them to exist or rust-project errors out. I have mode/mac 
there but you might need to create another mode file for another OS. Just make 
it empty like mine!
